# Web Flash Cards 

## Summary
In this project my team had to build a flash card appliction in which users will present users with decks of flash cards.  Users will select a deck and play a round of flash cards. After they play a round they will be notified of their count of attempts on each card. Users can also create new decks with all new cards. The app is built with Sinatra and ruby.
